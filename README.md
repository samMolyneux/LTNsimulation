My final year project at the University of Bath on 'Analysing proposed Low Traffic Neighbourhood-like schemes using agent-based traffic simulation'. To achieve this I utilised Python scripts and the SUMO traffic simulator to gain results based off real world data.
The data was first used to generate a list of viable start-end routes that matched the pattern of the detectors, the simulation was then run with these routes as input on a new road network to simulate a proposed scheme.

Code is provided as specified in the main body of the report
To run:
Ensure SUMO is installed
Run any bash file from the command line, ensuring all files are in the correct folder heirachy

Using sumo-gui with any of the configuration files provided (they may need to be alterd to ensure the file paths are suitable) will show a depiction of the simulation
